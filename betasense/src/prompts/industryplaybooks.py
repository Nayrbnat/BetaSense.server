Red Flags Framework - Structured Pattern Recognition:

GROWTH QUALITY RED FLAGS (High-Multiple Failure Patterns):
ðŸš¨ Deceleration Without Reacceleration:
   Signal: Revenue/user growth slowing 2+ consecutive quarters
   Validation: Check if cohort retention deteriorating (not just tough comps)
   Historical Cases: Peloton, DocuSign - pandemic pull-forward mistaken for sustainable growth
   Action: Stress test - if growth doesn't reaccelerate, is valuation justified at mature rates?

ðŸš¨ CAC Inflation Spiral:
   Signal: CAC rising >15% YoY while LTV/CAC compresses below 3x
   Validation: Check channel concentration - growth dependent on single degrading channel?
   Historical Cases: Blue Apron - Facebook CPMs rose 40% while conversion collapsed
   Action: Model worst case - can company grow profitably if CAC doubles?

ðŸš¨ Cohort Degradation:
   Signal: Newer customer cohorts show worse retention/monetization than earlier cohorts
   Validation: Demand cohort curves by vintage - flattening/declining = death spiral
   Historical Cases: Stitch Fix, Robinhood - later users were tourists, not believers
   Action: If company won't share cohort data, assume it's bad news

ðŸš¨ Engagement Collapse:
   Signal: MAU/DAU declining, session frequency dropping, power user churn rising
   Validation: Distinguish habitual usage from episodic/promotional usage
   Historical Cases: Robinhood - users were mercenary volatility chasers, not engaged investors
   Action: Require DAU/WAU/MAU disclosure. Non-daily habits = fragile retention

COMPETITIVE MOAT RED FLAGS:
ðŸš¨ AI Theater (No Measurable Learning):
   Signal: Claims "AI-powered" but can't demonstrate accuracy improvement metrics
   Validation: Ask - What's prediction accuracy? How has it improved QoQ? Where's compound learning?
   Historical Cases: Stitch Fix, Zillow Offers - algorithms never beat humans/baseline meaningfully
   Action: If AI is core thesis but metrics don't improve, it's marketing not moat

ðŸš¨ Foundation Model Disruption Risk:
   Signal: Core product replicable by ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini for free
   Validation: Test using GPT-4 to replicate core workflow - if possible = existential threat
   Historical Cases: Chegg - ChatGPT provided superior homework help at zero cost
   Action: Identify revenue streams defenseless against LLMs, underwrite decline scenario

ðŸš¨ Bundling Vulnerability:
   Signal: Product is feature-sized, platform giants could bundle for free
   Validation: Check if Microsoft/Google/Adobe roadmap mentions this category
   Historical Cases: DocuSign - Microsoft/Adobe added e-signature to Office/Acrobat
   Action: If solving narrow job-to-be-done, assume platform bundling within 24 months

ðŸš¨ Zero Switching Costs:
   Signal: Customers can migrate to competitor in <1 week with no data/workflow loss
   Validation: Ask customers - what would it take to switch? If "nothing" = no moat
   Historical Cases: Blue Apron - customers rotated freely between meal kit providers
   Action: Quantify switching costs in time/money. If <$10K and <1 month = commoditized

BUSINESS MODEL RED FLAGS:
ðŸš¨ Revenue Concentration with Existential Risk:
   Signal: >30% revenue from single stream facing regulatory/technology disruption
   Validation: Model scenario - what if regulators ban or new tech eliminates this stream?
   Historical Cases: Robinhood - 75% PFOF (regulatory), 30% crypto (cyclical volatility)
   Action: If concentrated revenue is high-margin AND at-risk, model zero scenario

ðŸš¨ Unit Economics Mirage:
   Signal: Improving unit economics claimed but driven by accounting tricks not reality
   Validation: Check if improvements from: longer payback assumptions, reduced support allocation, or marketing timing games
   Historical Cases: WeWork - "community-adjusted EBITDA" excluded actual costs
   Action: Recalculate unit economics using conservative assumptions, cash basis only

ðŸš¨ Technology Obsolescence Path:
   Signal: Core technology stack approaching end-of-lifecycle with migration risk
   Validation: Check technology roadmap - is platform modernization required? Migration risk to customers?
   Historical Cases: Legacy on-premise software unable to transition to cloud economics
   Action: Assess technology debt - if major replatforming needed, model 2-3 year revenue headwind

ðŸš¨ Security/Data Breach Pattern:
   Signal: Multiple security incidents or one major breach with customer data exposure
   Validation: Check customer trust metrics, churn spike post-incident, regulatory exposure
   Historical Cases: Various cybersecurity failures leading to customer exodus and regulatory fines
   Action: Major breach = 12-24 month cloud over growth, quantify customer acquisition headwind
