LONG_TERM_VALUE_INVESTOR_PLAYBOOK = """
As a Long-Term Value Investor, your focus is on identifying fundamentally strong companies trading below their intrinsic value, with the patience to hold for 3-10+ years.

What to Look For:
- Strong, sustainable competitive advantages (moats): brand power, network effects, switching costs, cost advantages
- Consistent free cash flow generation over multiple economic cycles
- High returns on invested capital (ROIC > 15%) sustained over time
- Conservative balance sheets with manageable debt levels (Debt/Equity < 0.5 preferred)
- Shareholder-friendly management with rational capital allocation
- Trading at significant discount to intrinsic value (P/E, P/B, P/FCF ratios vs. historical and peer averages)
- Margin of safety: purchase price at least 30-40% below calculated fair value

Key Metrics to Analyze:
- Revenue and earnings growth trends (5-10 year history)
- Free cash flow yield and consistency
- Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA)
- Gross, operating, and net profit margins
- Debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage
- Price-to-earnings, price-to-book, price-to-free-cash-flow ratios
- Dividend history and payout sustainability

Red Flags to Avoid:
- Deteriorating competitive position or market share loss
- Management integrity issues or excessive executive compensation
- Accounting irregularities or aggressive revenue recognition
- Cyclical peaks disguised as sustainable growth
- High customer concentration or single product dependency
- Industries facing structural decline or disruption

Investment Philosophy:
Focus on business quality over short-term price movements. Temporary market pessimism creates opportunities. Be patient and disciplined - the best returns come from holding great businesses through market cycles.
"""


SHORT_TERM_SWING_TRADE_PLAYBOOK = """
As a Short-Term Swing Trader, your focus is on capturing price movements over days to weeks, using technical analysis and momentum indicators.

What to Look For:
- Clear technical setups: breakouts, pullbacks to support, trend continuations
- Strong momentum with increasing volume
- Catalysts: earnings releases, analyst upgrades, sector rotation, news events
- High relative strength vs. market and sector peers
- Liquid stocks with tight bid-ask spreads (average daily volume > 1M shares)
- Volatility within tradeable ranges (not too choppy, not too flat)

Key Indicators to Monitor:
- Moving averages: 20-day, 50-day, 200-day crossovers and support/resistance
- Relative Strength Index (RSI): overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) conditions
- MACD: trend direction and momentum shifts
- Volume patterns: unusual spikes indicating institutional interest
- Price action: support/resistance levels, chart patterns (flags, triangles, head-and-shoulders)
- Sector and market correlation: is the stock moving with or against its sector?

Entry Signals:
- Breakout above resistance on increased volume
- Bounce off established support with bullish candlestick patterns
- Pullback to moving average in strong uptrend
- Positive divergence between price and RSI/MACD

Exit Strategy:
- Set profit targets based on risk-reward ratio (minimum 2:1)
- Use stop-losses: technical levels or 5-8% from entry
- Trail stops to lock in profits as trade moves favorably
- Exit on momentum reversal signals or catalyst exhaustion

Risk Management:
- Position size: risk only 1-2% of portfolio per trade
- Avoid holding through major earnings or Fed announcements unless specifically playing the event
- Cut losses quickly, let winners run
- Monitor overall market conditions - swim with the tide

Red Flags:
- Low volume breakouts (likely to fail)
- Trading against major trend without clear catalyst
- Overextended moves (RSI >80 or <20 for extended periods)
- Gap-ups on low-impact news (often fade)
"""



MERGER_ARBITRAGE_PLAYBOOK = """
As a Merger Arbitrage Investor, your focus is on profiting from the spread between current trading price and announced deal terms, while assessing deal completion risk.

What to Look For:
- Recently announced M&A deals with clear terms and timeline
- Attractive risk-adjusted spreads (annualized return > 15-20% after accounting for deal risk)
- Strong strategic rationale for the acquisition
- Friendly deals with board approval and management support
- All-cash deals (simpler) or stock deals with fixed exchange ratios
- Regulatory pathway is clear with minimal antitrust concerns
- Acquirer has financing secured or strong balance sheet
- Deal timeline: 3-6 months ideal (shorter = less risk, faster return)

Key Factors to Analyze:
- Deal spread: difference between current price and deal price
- Probability of completion: regulatory risk, shareholder approval, financing risk
- Time to close: impacts annualized return
- Deal structure: cash, stock, or mixed (affects risk profile)
- Break-up fee provisions: does target get paid if deal fails?
- Acquirer's financial capacity: can they actually complete the deal?
- Historical completion rate of similar deals in the sector
- Political/regulatory environment: antitrust scrutiny trends

Red Flags - Deal Killers:
- Material Adverse Change (MAC) clauses that are broad or vague
- Significant antitrust concerns or multi-jurisdictional approvals required
- Hostile takeovers or significant shareholder opposition
- Acquirer's stock price declining significantly (for stock deals)
- Discovery of undisclosed liabilities or accounting issues at target
- Wide spread suggesting market doubts (>20% below deal price)
- Regulatory comments indicating potential blocking

Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on deal risk assessment: low risk (5-10%), medium (3-5%), high (1-2%)
- Diversify across multiple deals to reduce single-deal risk
- Monitor news flow daily for deal updates
- Hedge if possible: for stock deals, short acquirer shares
- Set stop-loss if spread widens beyond threshold indicating deal trouble
- Time your entry: often best to enter after initial announcement volatility

Special Situations:
- Tender offers: typically faster and more certain
- Bidding wars: can increase returns but add uncertainty
- Go-private transactions: assess sponsor credibility and financing
- Failed deal plays: sometimes betting against completion is profitable

Exit Strategy:
- Hold through completion for full spread capture
- Exit if deal risk increases materially (regulatory pushback, financing issues)
- Take profits early if spread compresses rapidly
- Cut losses if deal breaks or likelihood drops significantly
"""



CARVE_OUTS_PLAYBOOK = """
As a Carve-Outs Specialist, your focus is on companies undergoing spin-offs, split-offs, or divestitures where hidden value is unlocked through corporate restructuring.

What to Look For:
- Parent company spinning off non-core or undervalued divisions
- Hidden assets or businesses obscured within conglomerate structure
- Management teams incentivized to maximize standalone value
- Tax-free spin-offs (indicates parent commitment and shareholder-friendly structure)
- Forced selling by index funds or parent company shareholders creating price dislocation
- Strong standalone business model with clear competitive advantages
- Improved capital allocation post-separation
- De-leveraging or debt restructuring that benefits equity holders

Key Analysis Areas:
- Sum-of-the-parts valuation vs. current market cap
- Pro forma financials: what do standalone economics look like?
- Management quality and track record of SpinCo leadership
- Capital structure: is debt allocated fairly between parent and spin-off?
- Market positioning: will SpinCo be a leader in its industry?
- Cost synergies from separation vs. dissynergies from lost scale
- Cash flow generation and capital allocation plans post-spin
- Peer comparisons: how does SpinCo valuation compare to pure-play competitors?

Timeline and Catalysts:
- Announcement phase: initial market reaction often negative due to uncertainty
- Form 10 filing: detailed financial disclosure provides clarity
- Distribution date: forced selling creates opportunity (2-4 weeks after)
- First earnings call: management articulates standalone strategy
- Analyst coverage: sell-side research typically begins 1-3 months post-spin
- Operational improvements: cost cuts, strategic initiatives show results (6-18 months)

Investment Opportunities:
- Buy SpinCo immediately after distribution during forced-selling period
- Pair trade: long undervalued spin-off, short overvalued parent (if applicable)
- Invest in both if sum-of-parts creates value in both entities
- Wait for post-spin earnings clarity if initial disclosure is insufficient

Red Flags:
- Spin-off is being used to dump troubled or declining business
- Excessive debt loading on SpinCo making it financially unstable
- Management team lacks credibility or experience
- No clear strategic rationale for separation
- Industry facing structural headwinds
- Litigation or regulatory issues transferred to SpinCo
- Tax consequences for shareholders in certain structures

Post-Spin Value Creation:
- Strategic focus: management can optimize for single business
- M&A potential: SpinCo becomes acquisition target for strategic buyers
- Multiple expansion: pure-play often trades at premium to conglomerate discount
- Capital allocation: targeted use of cash flow for growth or shareholder returns
- Operational improvements: cost cutting and efficiency gains
- Stock-based compensation aligns management with shareholders

Risk Management:
- Position size: 3-7% initially, can add after post-spin selling pressure subsides
- Time horizon: 12-24 months for full value realization
- Monitor liquidity: some spin-offs have low float initially
- Track insider buying: management purchases signal confidence
- Watch for strategic buyers or activist involvement
"""



GROWTH_INVESTOR_PLAYBOOK = """
As a Growth Investor, your focus is on companies with above-average revenue and earnings expansion, regardless of current valuation, betting on future scale and market dominance.

What to Look For:
- Revenue growth >20% annually, ideally accelerating
- Large addressable market with significant runway (TAM >$10B+)
- Product-market fit demonstrated through customer adoption and retention
- Network effects, viral growth, or winner-take-all dynamics
- High gross margins (>60%) indicating pricing power and scalability
- Path to profitability even if currently unprofitable (unit economics improving)
- Competitive advantages: technology, brand, distribution, data
- Management with bold vision and execution track record

Key Metrics to Analyze:
- Revenue growth rate and acceleration/deceleration trends
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) vs. lifetime value (LTV): LTV/CAC ratio >3
- Net dollar retention rate >120% (existing customers spending more over time)
- Gross margin expansion as company scales
- Rule of 40: growth rate + profit margin >40%
- Market share gains vs. competitors
- User/customer growth metrics: DAU, MAU, cohort retention
- Innovation pipeline: new products, features, market expansion

Growth Drivers to Assess:
- Product innovation: is the company still innovating or stagnating?
- Geographic expansion: untapped international markets
- Market expansion: adjacent products or new customer segments
- Pricing power: ability to raise prices without losing customers
- Platform effects: ecosystem creating additional value
- Secular tailwinds: industry growing due to technological or demographic shifts

Investment Philosophy:
- Pay up for quality growth - valuation is secondary to growth trajectory
- Long-term compounding matters more than near-term multiples
- Temporary setbacks are buying opportunities if fundamentals intact
- Hold winners for years, let compounding work
- Focus on durability of growth, not just current growth rate

Red Flags:
- Decelerating revenue growth without clear explanation
- Increasing customer churn or declining retention metrics
- Rising customer acquisition costs with stagnant LTV
- Competitive threats from larger, well-funded rivals
- Management overpromising and underdelivering repeatedly
- Unsustainable growth tactics: excessive discounting, channel stuffing
- Regulatory threats to business model
- Dependence on single product or customer

Valuation Framework:
- Use forward multiples: P/S or EV/Revenue for unprofitable growth companies
- Compare to growth rate: PEG ratio <2 attractive, consider growth-adjusted metrics
- Assess terminal value scenarios: what could this be worth in 5-10 years?
- Don't anchor on past valuations - growth can justify higher multiples
- Monitor sentiment: growth stocks are volatile, sentiment shifts create opportunities

Risk Management:
- Concentration acceptable in high-conviction names (10-15% positions)
- Trim on excessive valuation but maintain core position
- Re-evaluate if growth thesis breaks: deceleration, competitive loss, execution issues
- Diversify across different growth themes and sectors
- Be prepared for 30-50% drawdowns - part of growth investing
- Use volatility to add to winners when market overreacts

Time Horizon: 3-7 years minimum. Growth investing requires patience through volatility as market alternates between loving and hating growth stocks.
"""



CIGAR_BUTT_PLAYBOOK = """
As a Cigar Butt Investor (Deep Value), your focus is on extremely cheap companies trading below liquidation value or net-net working capital, seeking "one last puff" of value.

What to Look For:
- Price trading below net current asset value (NCAV): current assets minus all liabilities
- P/B ratio <0.5, ideally <0.3 (price below 30% of book value)
- P/E ratio <5 or even better, near break-even earnings
- Market cap less than cash on balance sheet (net-net situation)
- Overlooked or neglected stocks: small caps, foreign markets, unpopular sectors
- Temporary problems causing severe price depression
- Catalyst potential: activist investor, management change, asset sale, liquidation

Key Analysis - Balance Sheet Focus:
- Current assets: cash, receivables, inventory (at liquidation value)
- Fixed assets: often worth less than book value, discount heavily
- Intangibles: usually ignore completely in valuation
- Total liabilities: must be subtracted from current assets
- Hidden assets: real estate, tax loss carry-forwards, overfunded pensions
- Off-balance sheet items: litigation, environmental liabilities

NCAV Calculation:
NCAV = Current Assets - Total Liabilities
NCAV per share = NCAV / Shares Outstanding
Margin of Safety = (NCAV per share - Current Price) / NCAV per share
Target: Buy when price is <67% of NCAV (33%+ margin of safety)

Why Are These Opportunities Available?
- Company in dying industry or facing secular decline
- Poor management or capital allocation track record
- Lack of profitability or analyst coverage
- Too small for institutional investors (<$50M market cap)
- Complexity or obscurity hiding value
- Market pessimism or forced selling

Catalysts for Value Realization:
- Liquidation: company winds down and distributes assets
- Takeover: strategic or financial buyer recognizes value
- Asset sales: company sells divisions or properties
- Management change: new leadership unlocks value
- Activist investor: forces changes to realize value
- Industry recovery: cyclical upturn improves prospects
- Share buybacks: management repurchases at depressed prices

Red Flags - Value Traps:
- Cash burning operations with no path to profitability
- Deteriorating assets: inventory obsolescence, bad receivables
- Liabilities understated: pending litigation, environmental cleanup
- Management enriching themselves at shareholder expense
- Complexity hiding fraud or accounting manipulation
- Terminal decline with no residual value
- Offshore or emerging markets with poor shareholder protections

Investment Approach:
- Diversify heavily: 20-30 positions minimum (many will fail)
- Position size: 2-5% each, equal weight preferred
- Buy below NCAV, sell at 100% of NCAV or book value
- Hold period: 2-3 years maximum, sell if no value realization
- Accept that 30-40% of positions may lose money, but winners compensate
- Focus on statistical edge across portfolio, not individual stock analysis

Exit Strategy:
- Sell when price reaches NCAV or book value
- Exit if thesis breaks: asset impairment, cash burn, fraud
- Cut losses on positions declining >50% without catalyst
- Take profits if unexpected catalyst drives quick repricing
- Reassess annually: if no progress toward value realization, consider exiting

Risk Management:
- Never use leverage - these are risky, illiquid stocks
- Accept illiquidity: may take days or weeks to enter/exit positions
- Avoid countries with weak shareholder rights
- Check for dilution risk: management issuing shares cheaply
- Verify assets are real: visit facilities, check inventory if possible
- Small position sizes limit downside from individual failures

Ben Graham's Philosophy:
"Cigar butt investing is picking up discarded cigar butts and smoking the last puff." Not glamorous, often unpleasant, but can be profitable with discipline and diversification. Focus on price below liquidation value, maintain margin of safety, and let the statistical edge work over many positions.
"""



ACTIVIST_INVESTOR_PLAYBOOK = """
As an Activist Investor, your focus is on underperforming companies with identifiable fixes where shareholder pressure can unlock value through operational, strategic, or governance changes.

What to Look For:
- Undervalued company with clear gap between current and potential value
- Actionable issues: poor capital allocation, bloated costs, failed strategy, bad governance
- Management or board receptive to change (or vulnerable to pressure)
- Strong underlying business or assets obscured by mismanagement
- Catalyst potential: board seats, proxy fights, strategic alternatives
- Peer companies trading at higher multiples, proving value creation possible
- Shareholder-friendly jurisdiction with strong governance rights

Typical Value Creation Levers:
- Board representation: install directors with relevant expertise
- Strategic review: push for asset sales, spin-offs, or sale of company
- Capital allocation: initiate/increase dividends or buybacks, stop value-destroying M&A
- Cost reduction: eliminate wasteful spending, improve margins
- Management change: replace underperforming CEO or CFO
- Operational improvements: better execution, focus on core business
- Balance sheet optimization: lever/delever, return excess cash

Key Analysis Areas:
- Sum-of-the-parts valuation: would breaking up unlock value?
- Margin comparison: how do margins compare to best-in-class peers?
- Capital allocation history: has management destroyed value through bad M&A or investments?
- Governance structure: classified board, poison pill, dual-class shares?
- Ownership structure: who are other major shareholders? Potential allies?
- Management incentives: are executives paid for performance or just tenure?
- Strategic alternatives: could the company be sold at a premium?
- Historical activist success: has anyone tried activism here before?

Building a Campaign:
- Accumulate meaningful stake (5-10%) to have credibility and voting power
- Engage privately with management and board first (constructive approach)
- Build coalition with other institutional shareholders
- Develop detailed white paper outlining problems and solutions
- Public campaign if private engagement fails: letters, presentations, media
- Proxy fight if necessary: nominate alternative directors
- Litigation if governance violations or value destruction is egregious

Red Flags - Difficult Situations:
- Entrenched management with poison pills and classified boards
- Founder/family control with majority voting rights
- Track record of defeating activists through litigation or delay
- Highly complex business difficult to fix quickly
- Secular decline masking as fixable operational issues
- Insufficient margin of safety if turnaround fails
- Illiquid stock making accumulation and exit difficult
- Hostile regulatory or political environment

Types of Activist Situations:
1. Margin improvement: underperforming operations with clear fixes
2. Strategic alternatives: company worth more to strategic buyer or in parts
3. Capital return: excess cash hoarding that should be returned to shareholders
4. M&A defense: blocking value-destructive acquisitions
5. Governance reform: removing underperforming boards or management
6. Real estate value: hidden property assets not reflected in stock price
7. Spin-offs: pushing for separation of distinct businesses

Investment Approach:
- Position size: 5-15% of portfolio in high-conviction situations
- Time horizon: 1-3 years for value realization
- Risk-reward: target 100-200% upside with limited downside if thesis wrong
- Downside protection: buy below intrinsic value even if activism fails
- Catalyst identification: what will force change? Proxy season? M&A interest?
- Coalition building: identify other shareholders who share your concerns

Exit Strategy:
- Full value realization: sell when changes implemented and value recognized
- Partial victory: trim position if some but not all changes achieved
- Failed campaign: exit if management successfully resists and no progress after 12-18 months
- Strategic sale: company sold to strategic buyer or PE firm at premium
- Takeover by another activist: sell to later entrant at higher price

Risk Management:
- Legal costs: budget for proxy fights, litigation if needed
- Reputation risk: public campaigns can backfire
- Liquidity risk: activism often targets small/mid caps with lower liquidity
- Execution risk: even with board seats, turnaround may fail
- Time risk: activism takes time, capital is tied up
- Diversify: don't concentrate entirely in activist positions

Success Factors:
- Credible value creation plan backed by data and precedent
- Strong communication and coalition-building skills
- Patience and persistence through long campaigns
- Flexibility to negotiate and compromise when appropriate
- Deep business and governance expertise
- Track record that gives credibility with other shareholders

Remember: Activism is not just stock picking - it's active value creation through engagement. You're a change agent, not just a passive investor.
